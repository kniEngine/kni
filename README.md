# Kni

Kni is a simple and powerful .NET framework for creating games for desktop PCs, and mobile devices using the C# programming language. 

It is an open-source re-implementation of the discontinued [Microsoft's XNA Framework](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb200104.aspx).
Kni is a derivative of [MonoGame & XNA Touch](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame).
